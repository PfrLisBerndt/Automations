=Deprecations
The following method uses are _deprecated_ and will be removed in the next minor version bump. They show a warning if you use them unless otherwise stated. 

* All Clipboard module methods take a hash in order to specify which clipboards to interact with now take the symbols directly via a rest argument. 
* All Mouse module methods that took constant values now accept symbols. The old behaviour is deprecated now. 
* All XWindow class methods that take a hash in order to specify which windows to search now take the symbols directly via a rest argument. 
* All XWindow class methods that take a string as the window to search for are now accepting Regular Expressions. That means, in later version you have to pass in a regexp if you don't want to look for an entire title at once, i.e. <tt>"edit"</tt> won't find a "gedit" window, but <tt>/edit/</tt> will. <b>This doesn't show a warning. </b>
* XWindow.from_name has been deprecated. The old functionality (i.e. the ability to specify all search parameters) is now provided by the XWindow.from_search method. XWindow.from_name will be used as an alias for XWindow.from_title in the next version.
