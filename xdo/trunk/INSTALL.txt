INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
type "rake gem" to create a ruby gem, then "sudo gem install pkg/xdo" to install the gem. 
type "rake test" to run the unit tests (but while they're running, you cannot use your PC since they take control of it). 
type "rake rdoc" to generate the documentation. 
type "rake full_gem" to run the unit tests and build the gem.
